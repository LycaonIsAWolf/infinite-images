#Infinite Images

[Infinite Images](https://infiniteimages.herokuapp.com/) is an infinitely-nested imageboard with markdown support I made to brush up on my nodejs skills. You can make top level posts, and replies to those posts also function as their own threads. I'm not sure how useful this is, but it was fun. 

Made with [express](http://expressjs.com/), [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres), [basic-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-auth), [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked), and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer).
